CSCE 580: Artificial Intelligence
==================================================

This repository contains course notes, lectures, project descriptions, and other supporting material for [CSCE 580 - Artificial Intelligence](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/csce580/).

## Overview 
This course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer-based systems. As opposed to a traditional logic-based artificial intelligence (AI) course, a specific emphasis will be on statistical inference and machine learning. 

## Learning Goals:
* Underestanding classical as well as recently discovered methods in AI, and explore their potential applications.
* Building AI systems that make decisions and act in fully informed, partially observable, adversarial environments.
* Building AI systems that make probabilistic inferences in uncertain and dynamic environments.

The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley. The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero and Dan Klein. Student side autograding was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and Pieter Abbeel. We thank them for their permission to use it as a part of this course.
