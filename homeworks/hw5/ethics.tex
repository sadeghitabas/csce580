\paragraph{Ethics of AI}

Write an essay on ``what is the most important ethical issue/challenge that we need to address before creating the first instance of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?'' 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Write in this LaTeX template
	\item Write up to a maximum of 1000 words
	\item Make sure you reference related materials/papers/articles
	\item This homework is \emph{mandatory for graduate students}, while it is optional for undegrads 
	\item Undegrads will get bonus points if submit this homework
	\item Please only focus on one ethical issue that is most important to you and elaborate on why we need to address this important issue --- more specifically, you need to elaborate on intuitions behind your reasonning.
	\item I would recommend reading the following articles before start writing your own essay: \cite{bostrom2014ethics,taylor2016alignment,russell2015ethics,lachat1986artificial}
	\item The aim is not to write a comprehensive list of ethical issues as others, such as Nick Bostrom, have currently published about such foundational topics. However, I want you to write this essay from your own unique perspective, elaborate on your thoughts, provide examples, and use your own intuitions.
	\item You are free to discuss this with other classmates (and I would enourage it), but you need to turn in your own writing.
\end{itemize}
