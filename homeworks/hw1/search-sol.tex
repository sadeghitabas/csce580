{\color{red}
A heuristic is \textit{admissible} if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e., it is optimistic. Mathematically, for all node $n$, $0\leq h(n)\leq h^*(n)$, where $h^*(n)$ is the optimal cost to reach a goal from node $n$ and $h(n)$ is the cost indicated by the heuristic to reach a goal from node $n$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

A heuristic is \textit{consistent} if its estimate is always less than or equal to the estimated distance from any adjacent node to the goal, plus the cost of reaching that adjacent node. Mathematically, for every node $n1$ and each successor $n2$ of $n1$, $h(n1)-h(n2)\leq c(n1 \rightarrow n2)$, where $c(n1 \rightarrow n2)$ represent the cost of getting to $n2$ from $n1$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $h1$ overestimates the cost $S \to G$ as $5$ when it is $4$, so it is inadmissible. Note that only one counterexample is enough for finding out that a heuristic is not admissible. 

\item $h1$ is not consistent because $h(S) - h(A) \leq c(S \to A)$ is violated as $5 - 3 \leq 1$. Note that only one counterexample is enough for finding out that a heuristic is not consistent. 

\item $h2$ does not overestimate costs and is admissible. 

\item $h2$ is not consistent because $h(S) - h(A) \leq c(S \to A)$ is violated as $4 - 2 \leq 1$.
